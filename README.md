As a resident of beautiful Vancouver, I truly believe part of its beauty is because of its trees, especially the cherry trees that when bloom creates beautiful scenery. Trees also clean the air, absorbs rainwater, and provides bird habitat. I find it interesting to know which Vancouver neighbourhood has the greatest number of trees. which trees being planted most often in any of this neighbourhoods?

When it is cherry blossom blooming season, in which neighbourhood they can be found the most? Which neighbourhood has more tallest cherry trees? Different type of cherry trees may bloom in different times of the year. It would be useful to be able to investigate neighbourhoods for a specific kind of cherry tree. Here I am going to explore Vancouver trees dataset and answering following question.
