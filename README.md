As a resident of beautiful Vancouver, I truly believe part of its beauty is because of its trees, especially cherry trees that when bloom creates beautiful scenery. Trees also clean the air, absorbs rainwater, and provides bird habitat.
I find it interesting to know which Vancouver neighbourhood has the greatest number of trees. which trees being planted most often in any of these neighbourhoods? 

When it is cherry blossom blooming season, in which neighbourhood they can be found the most? Which neighbourhood has more tallest cherry trees?
Different type of cherry trees may bloom in different times of the year. It would be useful to be able to investigate neighbourhoods for a specific kind of cherry tree. 
Here I am going to explore Vancouver trees  dataset and answering following question.

### Questions of interest

1. Which Vancouver neighbourhood has the greatest number of trees?

2. Which trees are most planted in each neighbourhood over the years?

3. Where are the most cherry trees in Vancouver located?

4. How height and diameter of trees in Vancouver related?
